== Joining the Core Team

We're always looking for more people to join our Core Team, as there's plenty of work to go around.
There's no formal procedure for applying to the team, but it's fairly straightforward to get an invitation
to join it:

* contribute consistently over an extended period of time (e.g. 6-12 months)
* demonstrate a passion for what we're doing
* eventually an invitation will be extended to you to become part of RuboCop's team
